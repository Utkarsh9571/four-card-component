## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, i learned a lot about css grid, i've used flexbox before, but not the grid tool, and its amazing, a little confusing in start then after experimenting the different tools inside grid, it starts to be clear.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
